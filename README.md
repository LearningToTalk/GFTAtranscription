GFTAtranscription
=================

Praat code for transcribing the GFTA recordings on the L2T longitudinal study.

Meat of transcription part of the code will be based on the original script that Tristan Mahr made 
in 2012 for Allie Johnson and Megan Flood to do the GFTA transcription for the cross-sectional 
study in [tier2]DataAnalysis/GFTA/CrossSectional1_UW/   This is the gfta-transcription.praat file.

Front-end code for loading segmentation textgrid files and wordlist files and so on will be the 
same code that is used for other L2T tagging tasks in [tier2]DataAnalysis/PraatScripts.
